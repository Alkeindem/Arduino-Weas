# Arduino-Weas
Newbie Arduino Development

This is a simple and personal project. The idea is create a circuit by using an arduino board which turns on or off
a LED by just clapping. The circuit is composed by a sound sensor, a LED, the arduino UNO board and wires (obviously).

I'll be improving the project as long as I get better in programming.
